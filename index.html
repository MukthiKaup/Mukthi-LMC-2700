            <p class="biopara"> My name is Mukthi Kaup and I’m a 20-year old Media and Communications major from Atlanta, Georgia. I was originally born in the small town of Edison, New Jersey, and moved to Georgia when I was 8 years old—so while I try to call myself a Northerner, charmed Southern life has slowly but surely taken over that title. In addition to southern hospitality, I greatly enjoy traveling to new places and baking interesting dessert in my free time. I am impassioned by nature and music the most in my life, but nothing compares to my love of communicative arts. From a young age, I was always enthralled by media like literature, theatre, poetry, and cinema; the idea that words and visuals could evoke such influential change on people was and is inspiring to me. This inspiration is what has driven me to pursue media as a career.
